# Sentiment Prediction for Amazon Kindle Review

### Introduction
When we purchase a product on the e-commerce platform, we usually read reviews from other buyers to know whether the evaluation of the product is good or bad. Leveraging a large amount of text-based product review to automatically recognize the emotional evaluation of a text through the natural language processing and translating the potential business value into realistic business benefits are essential to the current e-commerce industry. In this project, we try to design a web-based product that incorporates different machine learning algorithms and front-end user interface.

> Topics
> * Web Crawling on Amazon Review Dataset as a model training database
> * Natural Language Processing to transform text-based data into numeric-based data
> * Comparison and Evaluation of Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms 
> * Web user interface design 
> * Sentiment prediction and information retrieval with highlighted key word

### Objective
The goal of this web-based NLP app is not only to classify the sentiment polarity of text paragraph, but also explore the differences of various machine learning algorithm on this specific topic. Furthermore, this completed product shows the product pipeline from data collection, data processing, modeling and implementation of the model into front-end user interface.

During Natural Language Processing, techniques including Stop words, lemmatization, POS tagging, stemming, TF-IDF score and word2vec will be utilized for transformation from unstructured data into structured data for further modeling.

Machine learning algorithms include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Long Short-term Memory with Keras backend to Tensorflow. And each model has its' own advantages and limitations on computing time and prediction accuracy.
